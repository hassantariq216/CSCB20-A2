As a student user, the student must be able to see Assignment information, such as the due dates, weightings, and an embedded link to the relevant handout (if any) for each assignment, when clicking on the 'Assignment' button and navigating towards the right hand side of the weekly schedule table. The same page may be opened when clicking on the 'Course Material' button.
